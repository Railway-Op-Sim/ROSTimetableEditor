# Timetable Editor for Railway Operation Simulator

This is a Qt5 built application which aims to simplify the creation of timetables for [Railway Operation Simulator](https://railwayoperationsimulator.com), a free and open source railway signalling simulation by Albert Ball.

This README is a work in progress. Information relating to building the project in Qt in Windows can be found [here](dev_help/Compiling_Deploying_Qt_Applications_Windows.md).
